# VBA
Ubisoft's Work

I had several projects when I worked to this company but with one major project with which I share with you the source code. Beware, the comments in the code are in french because I worked with a french team :)

THE MAJOR PROJECT : 

The purpose of this project was to improve productivity when we had to work with thousands of invoiced (pdf) and classify them. 

The program is in the file "MACRO_UBI_01.xlsb" : 
- It is designed to find all the invoices of the company and to give an user the possibility to open them with an hyperlink button easily
- The macro also can copy the invoices and store them according different criteria entered by the user (By Fiscal month, by accounting accounts, etc...)
- It also has a dashboard in which the user can take notes for every invoice selected. The dashboard uses data from an other excel file, with no vba code (MACRO_UBI_01_Target.xlsx). The program can then work on this file (send and receive data).

OTHER PROJECTS : 

- Analyse & Synthesis of data on several excel files in just one file. 
- Transforming unusable data into a well-constructed and pertinent database
